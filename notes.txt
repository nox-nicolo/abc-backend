Monday 27 Oct:

    Update the create API so that to match the new moedel from the application. 

    The structure of the post API:
        {
            "author": "User1__r7j4yu",
            "category": "two",
            "caption": "This is the caption of this post right now! #postofthepost #numberofpeople",
            "hashtags": [
                "#postofthepost",
                "#numberofpeople"
            ],
            "tagged": [
                "user6"
            ],
            "media": [
                {
                    "path": "/data/user/0/com.example.africa_beauty_community/cache/a5dd0d1e-bfa4-405a-b80e-3bd591f3669e/33.jpg",
                    "aspectRatio": 1.0
                },
                {
                    "path": "/data/user/0/com.example.africa_beauty_community/cache/532a3671-8f55-4801-a220-511f18b1dc6b2487752978095865833.jpg",
                    "aspectRatio": 1.0
                }
            ],
            "settings": {
                "ageRestriction": "Everyone",
                "disableReactions": false,
                "enableComments": false,
                "allowSharing": false,
                "pinned": false,
                "showLikes": false,
                "showLocation": false,
                "visibility": "Public"
            },
            "status": "Uploaded"
        }


    So since I have the previous API I have to make sure it align with this one.
